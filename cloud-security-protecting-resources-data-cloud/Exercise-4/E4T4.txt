# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Remove ssh access from the instance. Use Systems Manager if needed.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

It will not prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket. It will make communication
traffic of services within VCP to S3 to stay within AWS network and not public internet. 

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, existing objects do not get affected by encryption, only new objects do.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All the resources affected by changes via a CLI or Console will get to the original state.
