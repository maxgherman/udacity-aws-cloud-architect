Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

[CIS.4.1] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
[CIS.2.9] Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
[CIS.4.2] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
UDP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
securityhub-encrypted-volumes-98327f39 (EC2 volumes are not encrypted)

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Provide specific IP address range for security groups ingress on port 22
Enable VPC flow logging
Remove unrestricted access to port 3389
Remove access to all the mentioned ports reachable from the internet
Encrypt s3 buckets
Encrypt EC2 volumes
