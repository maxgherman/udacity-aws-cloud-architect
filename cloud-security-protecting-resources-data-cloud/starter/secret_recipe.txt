Layer 12 of them on an 11 x 15 inch buttered baklava pan,
brushing the sheets of dough with about half the butter.
Spread the filling on top and cover with the remaining 12

top layered sheets and filling diagonally into 2 inch long
diamonds, but leave the bottom few layers uncut.  Bake about
30 minutes.  Raise oven temperature to 475 F. and bake about
15 minutes longer or until golden.  Remove from oven.  Pour
the refrigerated syrup over the top of puffed dough. Cut,
using the same diagonals, through the uncut layer of dough
and serve the diamond-shaped slices when cooled.
